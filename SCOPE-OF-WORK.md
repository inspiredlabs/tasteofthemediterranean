# Scope of Work

## About

Taste of the Mediterranean <sup><small>LTD</small></sup>, is wholesale food distribution company esablished by **Alejandro Bustamante** following the acquisition of the [GreekFoods](https://greekfoods.netlify.app) company. It is a friendly, family business as recommended by&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Miliotis.

## Requirements

This doc aims to help take meaningful decisions to _"take the business to the next level"_. This will be done by bringing clarity to _"Agreed Outcomes"_, through clear deliverables.

### Alejandro&hellip; do you have time to add some input?

Getting to know the business is important. By developing our project **Requirements**, we can make technology that makes life easier, day-to-day:

- As a _"Deal Maker"_, what would you love to be able to do –&nbsp;if only there was a way?
- you charge different rates, to different people:
  - what is your ideal scenario here going-forward?
  - What are the most important features of a _"Customer Profile"_?
- your regular customers get a loyalty bonus (the same prices as Mel):
  - can we do MORE for these people?
  - do you know if they use mobile or desktop computers?
  - who are they exactly – and what can we learn here to help turn a profit?
- Loyalty Scheme: is more regular customers that get a loyalty bonus the objective of your business long-term, or do you prefer lots of smaller orders where there is a bigger price premium?
- up-to-date product list:
  - what is most profitable? EG:
    - what are the big cash orders you love?
    - do you use bulk-buying as a way to encourage people to spend more?
  - what is difficult to sell (or maybe goes stale), that you could advertise at a give-away price?
  - what are your common deals? Do you often sell groups of products that we can bundle together cleverly, perhaps with a difficult to sell item.
- We need a brand that works for your clients. What brands, logos or colour schemes do you think speak to your customers and why? This is different from making something that you simply "like". Remember: it's really for them!

### Customer Profile

This section helps understand who we are selling to and why they use your company, before another supplier. By making your customer's experience better, we can improve income: **what do you _really_ do for people that helps THEM make money?**

## Agreed Outcomes

Deliverables:

- Design application of _"The Brand"_ to assets:
- Primary asset: Webapp (inc. the design, build, deployment and maintenance of [TasteOfThe.Me](https://TasteOfThe.Me)).
  - This is the initial invoicing round.
  - maintenance: £85 pa. essentially this is simply domain upkeep following design and development.
- _"Other Assets"_:
  - Leaflets
  - Business cards
  - Email signature
  - Social media "frames"

### The Brand

Consists of colour scheme, logo & typography applied to:
- Webapp, to improve sales.
- Social media assets for ongoing _"Content Delivery"_.
- Print materials

### The Webapp

<!-- offline, works like an app -->
- informs people of what you do and helps make sales
- no prices
- branded
- Establish **Requirements** fit

## Content Delivery

Branded for sharing across Instagram (FB, Twitter, etc).

## Other Assets

To be determined.
